![img](img/41-120hz-ltpo-combined.png)

???

Tradeoff with 90Hz and above displays is substantially reduced battery life. 

During our test on the OnePlus 7 Pro, we noted 200 fewer minutes of browsing time when using the 90Hz mode versus the more standard 60Hz. In some cases, that battery tradeoff is simply not worth it ‚Äî for instance, with the Google Pixel 4 already suffering from questionable battery life, we recommend disabling the 90Hz mode to ensure a good day‚Äôs worth of use.

> ‚Ä¶is a location API in Google Play services that intelligently combines different signals to provide the location information that your app needs.

> ‚Ä¶manages the underlying location technologies, such as GPS and Wi-Fi, and provides a simple API that you can use to specify the required quality of service.

It is based on the seL4 microkernel, the world‚Äôs first and still only

bug-free implementation** extending all the way to machine
code, and mathematical proofs of enforcement of securityrelevant isolation. Being based on this rock-solid foundation,
SEOS inherits seL4‚Äôs provable security and, unlike any other

amps = watts / volts | 0.805 / 3.8 = 0.2118 amps | 2100 / 211.8 = 10 h

???

By applying this methodology to the S3, we can directly measure: the CPU cores, RAM, 3D GPU and several general system-on-chip (SoC) supplies. 

For the SoC, we distinguish three supplies: MIF (memory interface), INT (internal), and remaining miscellany SoC. 

Measuring power supplies to the radios is less straightforward: they are very sensitive to noise in the power supply, and therefore, some of their power is supplied from linear regulators, which are typically less energy efficient but show superior noise performance.

# Android history

Lazy first

## Reduce

## Defer

## Coalesce

???

Making your app Lazy First means looking for ways to reduce and optimize operations that are particularly battery-intensive. The core questions underpinning Lazy First design are:

**Reduce**: Are there redundant operations your app can cut out? For example, can it cache downloaded data instead of repeatedly waking up the radio to re-download the data?

**Defer**: Does an app need to perform an action right away? For example, can it wait until the device is charging before it backs data up to the cloud?

**Coalesce**: Can work be batched, instead of putting the device into an active state many times? For example, is it really necessary for several dozen apps to each turn on the radio at separate times to send their messages? Can the messages instead be transmitted during a single awakening of the radio?

You should ask these questions when it comes to using the CPU, the radio, and the screen. Lazy First design is often a good way to tame these battery killers.

battery saver mode. AOSP builds restrictions:

* aggressive app standby mode
* background limits regardless of their target API level
* location services disabled when the screen is off
* background apps do not have network access
* device-specific power optimizations
